## Abstract
    Neurodegenerative diseases are a serious issue which encompasses a myriad of complex and incurable disorders. in this thesis, we focus on Parkinson’s disease (PD), specifically; the detection of PD though the automatic analysis of offline handwriting. To accomplish this task; we propose Park-Net, our own convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. We proceed to test this CNN on three PD handwriting datasets before comparing the results to state-of-the-art works, and with a 98% accuracy, and to the best of our knowledge; Park-Net outperforms studies as recent as (2022).

## Data Sets used
    In this work we made use of 3 freely available PD handwriting datasets: HandPD,
    NewHandPD, and Parkinson’s drawing. with a consistant image size of 244px x 244px.

## GUI implementation
    Simple implementation done using the tkinter library.
